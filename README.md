CA357 Project: A potential new look for Bank of Ireland's website

**Assignment spec:**

The growth of truly interactive systems has brought many challenges to those engaged in the design of good user interfaces and user experience. The problem of satisfying users needs and requirements is exacerbated by the fact that the system is now accessed on a multitude of different devices and from a variety of locations or contexts. Your job in this assignment is to choose from alternative applications and design a prototype user interface, and then evaluate how effectively your design has worked..

you are required to select a suitable web or app based digital product that you wish to develop. Your product may be totally original or based on an existing product that you think can be enhanced through an improved user interface. Examples may include:

A totally original web or mobile app.
An improved eCommerce web or mobile app. Examples might be an online banking app, a travel system, a shop.
An improved informational web or mobile app. examples might be a newspaper, something related to DCU, something which helps a user find a service or facility.
A simple game such as Solitaire, or a board game of some kind. Note: Please do not consider one-person-shooter games, or anything complex. These are extremely difficult, and you lack the time and resources to design the UI and interaction experience effectively.
Something entirely different which does not fall into any of these categories.
Select your product carefully. Choose something that you think has scope for improvements. You are designing a new, improved interface with original ideas that will make it a better experience for the user. Also, if it is an eCommerce site, be aware that in order to gain user requirements, you may need to actually purchase products. It is not a requirement of this module that you do so. However, please choose the application, tasks, and users carefully.
